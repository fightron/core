## Team

A Team is a group of Characters.

Teams are used, among other things, for HUDs, and collision detection (no friendly fire for when multiple characters of the same team are active).

Teamplay is not currently implemented, but using "teams of one" as a starting point will make this feature easier to implement when the time comes.
