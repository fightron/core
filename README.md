* [__Gameplay__](./gameplay/README.md): classes directly related to gameplay.
* [__Meters__](./meters/README.md): character meters (Health, Special, etc).
* [__Resources__](./resources/README.md): data entities.
* [__Utils__](./utils/README.md): helper classes

Each namespace has its own README. Click the links above to read them.
